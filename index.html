<h1>The Rhizome Artbase: “entropy8.com”</h1>
<p>This is a paragraph.Entropy8 was a landmark in the history of net art, made my Auriea Harvey in 1995.
Entropy8 with even with it limitations was able to create an experience like no other that I have
seen. Entropy8 uses graphs that remind me of old horror games that you would find on oline at 3
in the morning. Entropy8 in my opain has a look and fincthin of a puzzle game, that you have to
click and explera the sulleing of the game to find hints to the puzzle. Personally, it’s not my type
of game but I do enjoy the graphs and art stype of the game.</p>
